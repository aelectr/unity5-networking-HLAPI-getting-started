# What's this?
I needed to implement a networking application with a server in a local network, with no Internet access.
Then I found that unity5 networking api providing exactly what i want.
So I studied manual, scripting API and made simple implementation.

# Features
- Auto discovery( make clients discover server's address at startup )
- Manage client connection status with scroll view.
- Send custom network message.
- Auto reconnecting when the client has lost connection.

# The fast track
